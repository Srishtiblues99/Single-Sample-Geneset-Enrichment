# Single-Sample-Geneset-Enrichment method is an extension of the GSEA method, working at the level of a single sample rather than a sample population as in the original GSEA application. The score derived from ssGSEA reflects the degree to which the input gene signature is coordinately up- or downregulated within a sample.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a method for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in a specific cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.
